# Sunny Land

## Welcome!
Welcome to the Sunny Land project! This game is a simple 2D platformer made in the Godot Game Engine. This is one of my first ever games, and this is only considered, and should be treated as, a prototype.

#
## Building the Game
This section demonstrates how to download the project and work with it.
### Prerequesities
* [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) - Download the version of which OS you have.
### How to Build
1. Download the Godot Engine (it should say download in the top toolbar) and download either the standard version or the mono version. This project was made on a 64bit system, so I cannot test whether it works on a 32bit system or not.
2. Open the Godot executable and go to "Import". Open the folder in which you downloaded this project.
3. And there you go! If you need some help, feel free to contact me.
